## Bonus recipes:
### Veggie'n'Cheese
- Put a cheese of your taste in the oven to melt :)
 - Cut raw vegetables like sticks.
 - Prepare a "vinegrette" : vinegar, oil, herbs, salt and pepper.
 - Present as you like and enjoy ;)
### No-bread sandwich styles: 
- Cubecombert : Cut in half a cubecombert and remove the seeds
- Wrap : Use turkey meat or latus  as a wrap 
- Asian : use rice, nori, cabbage ...
- Fried : Fry vegetables of your choice with eggs and flour to get a veggie bred-like to sandwich with ( some talk about baking soda and citric acid to make it more bread-like but it's out of the scope )

As you can see recipes are more guidelines than a specific procedure to follow, i hope you like it better this way :)
